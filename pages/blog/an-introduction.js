          </header>

          <p>
            In the fall of 1990 more than 39 million Americans watched Ken
            Burns&rsquo;s documentary series <em>The Civil War</em> and were
            introduced to a southern gentleman with a blue shirt and a voice
            that sounded like seersucker and bourbon. His name was Shelby Foote.
            Fifteen years earlier he had finished a massive trilogy on the Civil
            War, an odd work of narrative history that fell broadly into the
            category of military history, but boasted prose influenced by Homer,
            Thucydides, and Proust rather than the faux-literary journalistic
            English of his peers in the Civil War Centennial publishing boom. He
            had spent more than fifteen years writing it&mdash;putting his
            career as novelist on indefinite hold to do so. The trilogy was well
            reviewed at the time, but he was by no means a household name until
            the Ken Burns series. None other than Robert Penn Warren himself
            suggested Burns recruit Foote for his documentary, and the filmmaker
            made ample use of the novelist. Of the 690 minutes of the massive
            series, Shelby Foote appeared in 89 segments and for about an hour
            of speaking time&mdash;dwarfing the screen exposure of the other
            featured historians. The documentary made him a star. Within a few
            weeks of the end of the Ken Burns series, his trilogy was selling
            over a thousand copies a day. &ldquo;Ken, you made me a
            millionaire,&rdquo; Foote supposedly told the filmmaker. Foote spent
            the last fifteen years of his life as a literary celebrity and elder
            statesman, with all the media appearances and honorary degrees that
            entails.
          </p>
          <h2>Changes in Interpretation</h2>
          <p>
            The three volumes of Foote&rsquo;s{' '}
            <em>The Civil War: A Narrative </em>were published in 1958, 1963,
            and 1975, a time of sweeping social change in the American south.
            Parallel to this was a dramatic course correction in the
            historiography of the Civil War and its place in American memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking in very broad strokes, until World War Two the story of the
            War Between the States was the story of a fraternal conflict between
            white Southerners and white Northerners that was fought for vague
            reasons: agrarianism vs. industrialism, rural vs. urban, tradition
            vs. progress. The southern boys did not fight for slavery but for
            hearth and home. After the debacle of World War One, there was even
            one of those blessed and hard-won periods when all war was dismissed
            as useless and tragic, a perspective that left its mark on even some
            Civil War scholarship.
          </p>
          <p>
            This interpretation of the Civil War grew directly from the writing
            of Southern leaders who sought to justify their part in the
            conflict, a historiography known as the Lost Cause. This
            myth&mdash;for a myth it was&mdash;was uncritically repeated even by
            Northern writers in the years following the war. Lee was a saint.
            Longstreet had failed him at Gettysburg. The South had fought
            valiantly but been done in by the technology, money, and numbers of
            the Federals. And it had not been about slaves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps this was the metanarrative that white America needed as it
            sought reconciliation and unity. That is a controversial assertion,
            but what is certainly clear is that the Lost Cause was enormously
            successful in shaping the public memory of the war and is a direct
            reason that so many Confederate monuments pepper the cities south of
            the Ohio River and east of the Rockies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The centennial of the Civil War began in 1961, a time of the Pax
            Americana, the American consensus, the &ldquo;affluent
            society&rdquo;, and military advisors in what was once French
            Indochina. Northerners were developing their own voice in Civil War
            histories. This was the apotheosis of Bruce Catton. In popular works
            like Catton&rsquo;s, to speak about the war meant to focus almost
            entirely on military history. The analysis of the war&rsquo;s
            origins was often a sketchy blur of Clay, Calhoun, Webster, Toombs,
            Bleeding Kansas, Dred Scott&rsquo;s lawsuit, John Brown&rsquo;s
            body, and the election of 1860. Like a high school history class it
            is long on names, dates, and proper-noun events, but short on
            context and the economics which drove the motivations of many. The
            war&rsquo;s epilogue was likewise often short on detail and
            perspective. I understand why&mdash;which would be a better ending
            for a story: Lincoln&rsquo;s funeral train bending over the horizon
            or the ignominious end of Reconstruction at the Compromise of 1877?
          </p>
          <p>
            Gaining steam in the American imagination&mdash;especially
            imaginations Northern and urban&mdash;was the narrative that America
            was a great but imperfect nation which was gradually extending its
            blessings of liberty and prosperity to more and more groups: first
            white landowners, then all white men, then black men (to an
            uncertain extent), then women, and finally, the taking up of a dream
            deferred with Civil Rights legislation. It took a while for this
            view to make its mark on Civil War scholarship, but it was making
            itself definitively felt by the 1970s.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1988, two books were released that have set the terms of
            discussion on the Civil War that I expect to last beyond my
            lifetime. Eric Foner published his{' '}
            <em>
              Reconstruction: America&rsquo;s Unfinished Revolution 1863-1877
            </em>{' '}
            and James McPherson published <em>The Battle Cry of Freedom. </em>
            Neither of these men were military historians. Both were more
            interested in the Emancipation Proclamation than Jackson&rsquo;s
            flank attack on the Union right at Chancellorsville. They placed the
            Civil War in the context of social and economic change in the
            nineteenth century, the most important of which in that time being
            not Gettysburg, Vicksburg, or anything done with muskets, but the
            emancipation of four million black people held in violent bondage.
            David Blight, another brilliant contemporary historian, provides a
            good rule of thumb for what an accurate Civil War history ought to
            be in his Yale course on the period: one third on the causes of the
            conflict, one third on the war, and one third on Reconstruction.
            These are not the only major contemporary historians, but rather the
            three with which I am most familiar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of them is quite aware of the power of the Civil War in the
            national memory, and how the conflict morphs from generation to
            generation as the American people break apart and recombine shards
            of memory to face new conditions and challenges. This is revisionist
            history&mdash;not in the pejorative sense but in the best sense of
            the word. Their work has truly changed the public discourse around
            the war, and while it was only barely reflected in Ken Burns&rsquo;s
            documentary, its interpretation has been widely disseminated in
            periodicals like Smithsonian Magazine, The New York Times, and even
            the History Channel. This movement has finally proven to the
            American public, beyond any doubt whatsoever, that the war was about
            slavery, slavery, slavery. For that thinking people ought to be
            eternally grateful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their ability to &ldquo;zoom out&rdquo; and focus on the grand sweep
            of the war, rather than getting bogged down in bright and tempting
            specifics, has also changed the story which military historians
            tell. Where Grant was once an unimaginative butcher, he is now the
            master strategist. Where Sherman was once this conflict&rsquo;s
            devil, he is now the visionary inventor of total war. Lee&rsquo;s
            reputation has tumbled down to earth in contrast, as historians now
            recognize the general&rsquo;s myopia when it comes to events outside
            of his beloved Virginia and his misbegotten wasting of his army in
            repeated assaults. Moving away from individuals, the new military
            history of the Civil War puts more emphasis on campaigns than
            battles and gives greater emphasis to the campaigns outside
            Virginia, the blockade, and the North&rsquo;s brilliant use of its
            logistical advantage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pendulum, however, has by now swung, I believe, to another
            extreme, and in the public imagination there is a reading of the
            Civil War almost reciprocal to the old Lost Cause myth. Taking on
            aspects of the new historical consensus that the war was
            (eventually) fought to free slaves, they view the Union armies as
            noble, avenging armies which fought against white supremacy. Of
            course, any Manichean reading of history is false, or at the very
            least unbalanced. This reading, though, serves an important purpose
            to segments of the country who desire a sudden correction to the
            sins of our nation against our black brothers and sisters, and more
            so, a systemic change to address the structures which put blacks at
            an instant disadvantage in our supposedly meritocratic society.
          </p>
          <h2>Reaction Against Foote</h2>
          <p>
            And this brings us back to Shelby Foote. While known as a historian,
            not a novelist, after the release of the trilogy, Foote was viewed
            by many in the trade as an interloper&mdash;for his refusal to use
            footnotes, for his reliance on published material for sources, for
            his outdated historiography.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fame in the 1990s brought with it renewed criticism. Almost as soon
            as Ken Burns released <em>The Civil War </em>historians pointed out
            that it did not send a clear message that the war was fought over
            slavery. Shelby Foote exemplified to many what was wrong with the
            documentary: sympathetic to the south, focused on the white
            experience in the war almost exclusively, and a view that soldiers
            were not fighting about slavery.
          </p>
          <p>
            The normally staid David Blight has called Foote&rsquo;s explanation
            on why the North won the war &ldquo;bullshit&rdquo;. In 2010 and
            2011 Ta-Nehisi Coates read the trilogy, and wrote about it in
            several of his columns for the Atlantic in this period, finding
            Foote&rsquo;s work engaging, but his naivet&eacute; regarding the
            history of the Ku Klux Klan in an 1999 Paris Review interview
            appalling, and the work lacking in what would truly teach people
            about the war. While Coates read Foote&rsquo;s work, much of the
            criticism of Foote is centered upon his contribution to
            Burns&rsquo;s documentary. That makes perfect sense&mdash;America is
            more of a &ldquo;watching&rdquo; culture than a reading culture, and
            has been for quite a while, and it is far easier to grapple with an
            hour of sound bites in a documentary than 3,000 pages of text.
          </p>
          <h2>The Point of this Blog</h2>
          <p>
            Having told you that history has moved on without Shelby Foote, I am
            going to read Shelby Foote&rsquo;s{' '}
            <em>The Civil War: A Narrative</em> and blog as I do so. I am going
            to take frequent breaks to write about Foote&rsquo;s life and other
            work (especially his novel <em>Shiloh)</em>, the slim scholarship on
            Foote&rsquo;s historical writing (especially James Panabaker&rsquo;s{' '}
            <em>Shelby Foote and the Art of History)</em>, as well as different
            editions of Foote&rsquo;s work and other arcane amusements.
          </p>
          <p>
            My belief is that Foote&rsquo;s work has been mis-labeled as to
            genre. While I&rsquo;m sure it gave Foote pleasure to be considered
            a historian in his later years, his work&rsquo;s strength lies in
            the aesthetics of its prose and not in his research or
            interpretation of facts. Shelby Foote was of the generation of
            writers who had internalized the innovations of Faulkner and
            Hemingway and practiced their craft with a subtlety in American
            letters that will not be seen again, I think. Foote&rsquo;s use of
            close third-person omniscient narration is the finest I&rsquo;ve
            seen in a work of nonfiction, as delicate as its use in the novels
            of Richard Yates.
          </p>
          <p>
            That being said, I will not shy away from discussing its merits as a
            work of history. The trilogy is a fluent retelling of the
            conflict&rsquo;s military aspects, and one that was well ahead of
            its time in the equal time it gave the Western Theater, among other
            aspects. I also hope to learn more about Shelby Foote than I do now,
            to understand this chronicler of Southern memory, who for a while
            was presented as a member of the historical academy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this introduction I have written quite a bit about the Ken Burns
            documentary, but I plan to mainly ignore it from here on out. I
            still haven&rsquo;t forgiven Burns for the philistinism of his Jazz
            documentary, or his haircut for that matter. Foote&rsquo;s trilogy,
            and its literary qualities, are going to be my main concern.
          </p>
          <h2>My own Perspective</h2>
          <p>
            I am a Yankee. More than that I am a school teacher from Rhode
            Island in my mid-30s. I studied economics at Brown University. I am
            embarrassed to say that I was a Civil War buff as a child, of a
            particularly severe sort. I think it may have been watching
            &ldquo;Civil War Journal&rdquo; that did it to me. I remember with
            particular clarity an episode on color guards that made a big
            impression on me. I did not see the Ken Burns documentary, but I had
            the big, thick book that was companion to the PBS series. My parents
            gave me the amazing (or so I thought at the time) Time-Life series
            which had metallic gray covers and fantastic battle maps. I also had
            an American Heritage book of battle maps that had been excised from
            one of Bruce Catton&rsquo;s many single volume histories of the war.
            I was enough of an obsessive my parents bought me several volumes of
            the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion. I regret that I
            did not get much out of them. (As an aside, these were a major
            source for Shelby Foote).
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a Catholic, having come to the faith in my mid-20s, and it is
            primarily through this lens that I see the world. More than that, I
            suppose I am an idiosyncratic sort of Catholic&mdash;attracted to
            the Benedictine tradition, pacifism, contemplative prayer, and
            whatnot. I enjoy reading most of all. Lately some favorites of mine
            have been Flannery O&rsquo;Connor, Hans urs von Balthasar, John
            Milbank, the Knox translation of the Vulgate, Walker
            Percy&mdash;especially <em>Lost in the Cosmos&mdash;</em>and books
            about John Coltrane<em>. </em>While Flannery O&rsquo;Connor is my
            favorite writer, the novels I most admire are{' '}
            <em>The Great Gatsby </em>by Fitzgerald, <em>Stoner </em>by John
            Williams, <em>Fat City </em>by Leonard Gardner,
            <em>The Easter Parade, </em>and <em>Revolutionary Road, </em>both by
            Richard Yates. My interest in the Civil War is a bit anti-type when
            it comes to my other interests, I suppose.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remember seeing ads for Shelby Foote&rsquo;s trilogy in Civil War
            Times as a child, both the spartan original hardcover edition and
            those gorgeous trade paperback covers which Vintage printed. I
            don&rsquo;t think I remembered Shelby Foote again until I read the
            Modern Library list of the top 100 nonfiction books from the 20
            <sup>th</sup> Century. After that, it was mostly through my
            enjoyment of Walker Percy that I became interested in his childhood
            friend Shelby.
          </p>
          <p>
            This will be the second time I read the trilogy through. While
            reflecting upon why I love Shelby Foote&rsquo;s{' '}
            <em>The Civil War</em> so much, I was reminded that the two
            translations of the Bible I most admire are the aforementioned Knox
            Bible and the New English Bible. Neither of these are hyper-literal
            translations of the Hebrew and Greek originals but are instead
            rendered in a fluent and elegant style that leaves me wanting to
            continue reading. I get the same feeling as I read Foote&rsquo;s
            work. Like those two translations, Foote has emphasized beauty and
            the grand sweep of a story which affects all of us. Like the titular
            prince in Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s <em>The Idiot</em>, I have this
            fanciful notion that beauty will save the world. It is for that
            reason that I share Walker Percy&rsquo;s enthusiasm for
            Foote&rsquo;s <em>The Civil War </em>and belief that it might just
            be &ldquo;read in the ruins&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            I have no wish to cover my eyes and avoid the hard truth of slavery,
            and all of America&rsquo;s complicity in it. If you truly want a
            deep and broad knowledge of this period, I highly suggest watching
            David Blight&rsquo;s Civil War lectures on Yale Open Courses, and,
            if you can, read the books he assigns. Let it not be said that my
            attraction to Foote&rsquo;s work is a reaction against the reading
            of history that Blight imparts in this amazing course. Shelby Foote
            will give you a different sort of knowledge.
          </p>
