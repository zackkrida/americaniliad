            People who know very little about Shelby Foote&rsquo;s{' '}
            <em>The Civil War: A Narrative</em> know that it begins and ends
            with the person of Confederate president Jefferson Davis. We will
            get deeper into Foote&rsquo;s treatment of Davis later, and of
            course the work done by the trilogy&rsquo;s ambiguous conclusion,
            but let&rsquo;s read the gorgeous <em>in media res</em> first
            paragraph of Foote&rsquo;s first volume:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              It was a Monday in Washington, January 21; Jefferson Davis rose
              from his seat in the Senate. South Carolina had left the Union a
              month before, followed by Mississippi, Florida, and Alabama, which
              seceded at the rate of one a day during the second week of the new
              year. Georgia went out eight days later; Louisiana and Texas were
              poised to go; few doubted that they would go, along with others.
              For more than a decade there had been intensive discussion as to
              the legality of secession, but now the argument was no longer
              academic. A convention had been called for the first week in
              February, at Montgomery, Alabama, for the purpose of forming a
              confederacy of the departed states, however many there should be
              in addition to the five already gone. As a protest against the
              election of Abraham Lincoln, who had received not a single
              southern electoral vote, secession was a fact&mdash;to be
              reinforced, if necessary, by the sword. The senator from
              Mississippi rose. It was high noon. The occasion was momentous and
              expected; the galleries were crowded, hoop-skirted ladies and men
              in broadcloth come to hear him say farewell. He was going home.

            Some hallmarks of Foote&rsquo;s narrative history make themselves
            known in the here: people and their gestures come first, followed by
            the history. We see Jefferson Davis sitting and then we see him
            standing. Foote runs through a brief telling of the Secession
            Crisis, as if in an observer&rsquo;s memory as we watch the
            Mississippi senator stand up to take the floor and wonder what this
            could be about. To commandeer a term from music, this legato
            technique of combining historical and personal data is the most
            distinctive thing about Shelby Foote&rsquo;s historical writing.
            When we get to the famous chapter on Gettysburg, &ldquo;The Stars in
            their Courses&rdquo;, we will have a close read of the subtle
            changes in perspective the writer takes us on as we drift from
            Beauregard and Longstreet&rsquo;s respective plans for a Confederate
            summer offensive in 1863, the current state of Vicksburg, the debate
            on military policy in Davis&rsquo;s cabinet, and then the figure of
            Lee, who we see through Davis&rsquo;s star struck eyes and then
            through the sober analysis of John Reagan, the confederate
            Postmaster General. The effect of it is like a long tracking shot
            that takes us across multiples states over several months. This
            opening paragraph is not so complex, nor should it, be, but is made
            with the same sort of tools.

            After the fluidity of several sentences requiring commas and dashes
            to organize the thoughts in print, Foote applies the brakes with two
            short, declarative sentences: &ldquo;The senator from Mississippi
            rose. It was high noon.&rdquo; Varied sentence length and
            complementary sentence structures are among the oldest techniques in
            the Anglophone storyteller&rsquo;s toolbox, and were once the signs
            of good rhetoric and writing&mdash;since the 1960s, I am sad to say
            that I feel our language in both its written and spoken forms has
            gotten rather rhetorically flat and undifferentiated.&nbsp;

            One does not need to see Jefferson Davis as a Christ figure (Shelby
            Foote is too much of a modernist to see anyone as a Christ figure)
            to see that, &ldquo;it was high noon&rdquo; is the borrowing of a
            technique used in John&rsquo;s Gospel. Foote seemed to be familiar
            with at least parts of the King James Bible, judging from his choice
            of an obscure epigram from Ecclesiasticus chapter 44 (a book also
            known as Sirach or The Wisdom of Ben Sira, which is canonical in
            Catholic and Orthodox Bibles but printed in the apocrypha of
            Protestant Bibles like the King James). He would have known how in
            John, abstract non-sequiturs (such as the observation &ldquo;and it
            was night&rdquo; as Judas left to betray Jesus to the temple
            authorities) accompany momentous events and actions. In the Gospel,
            they have a certain symbolic and suggestive power teased out over
            centuries in the tradition of meditative reading. &nbsp;Here, it has
            more modern suggestions. I doubt Foote meant to call to mind Western
            films, but as I read I think of an observer suddenly pulled into the
            present by a dramatic gesture and looking up at the clock. I hear
            distant church bells.

            The first fourteen pages of the trilogy are devoted to Jefferson
            Davis&rsquo;s life up until this point, and what history of the
            South and rising sectionalism Foote can squeeze in as he tells the
            story. It is important to note that the thing that instantly sets
            Foote&rsquo;s history apart from the work of modern histories is
            that Foote is self-consciously writing a history made up of the
            lives and decisions of Great Men. This was the norm from Thucydides
            all the way to the nineteenth century. It seems strange to us now, a
            century into the mainstreaming of Marxist ways of viewing and
            interpreting history and a half century into the corrective movement
            in which we privilege the narratives of women, minorities, the poor,
            and other people &ldquo;written out&rdquo; of the old history. These
            ways of writing history are both commendable and important, but we
            should also recognize that the work of a Tacitus or a Petrarch was
            not meant to educate the young in a democratic society where we feel
            we are owed role models and representation. Historical figures were
            presented as heroes to emulate, victims of tragedy to learn from. In
            a later post we will get into Foote&rsquo;s admiration for this type
            of history and his attempt reproduce its effect in a 20<sup>th</sup>{' '}
            century work about 19<sup>th</sup> century events.&nbsp;

            The most strongly worded criticism of Shelby Foote&rsquo;s trilogy
            I&rsquo;ve seen was in one of Ta-Nehesis Coates&rsquo;s columns in
            The Atlantic, in which he wrote, &ldquo;And yet here is the bit of
            sadness: [Foote] gave twenty years of his life, and three volumes of
            important and significant words to the Civil War, but he could never
            see himself in the slave.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Coates has some important things to say about Foote in this column
            and others, things important and true enough that I want to reflect
            on them later exclusively, and not shoehorned into a post that was
            supposed to be just about this book&rsquo;s first paragraph! I think
            there is more smoke than fire in this critique, however. To echo
            part of Cornell West&rsquo;s critique of Coates, he often sees race
            in a vacuum, separated from class and other determining factors. I
            can&rsquo;t imagine reading deep into the third volume of
            Foote&rsquo;s trilogy, as Coates did, and not noticing that Foote
            takes us almost exclusively in the world of Generals and their
            staffs, Presidents and their cabinets. It seems that Foote is loath
            to fill the page with too many proper nouns. I think this is one of
            the things that makes his story flow so well. There is a cast of
            hundreds, yet we never feel as if we have forgotten whether Elisha
            Rhodes, the famous diarist from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Rhode Island
            Infantry, fought for the North or South. There are many unattributed
            quotes in this work that prefers to cite a quote by &ldquo;one
            southern diarist&rdquo; than &ldquo;Mary Chestnut, Charleston
            diarist&rdquo;. Sometimes what makes great history and great
            literature are mutually exclusive.
          </p>

            I will not be spending this blog popping the balloons of everyone
            who criticizes Foote. I relish the opportunity to later speculate
            why Foote&rsquo;s later interviews seem to be from a totally
            different perspective than his trilogy, and share Coates alarm at
            some of these statements. (I also acknowledge that in Coates
            statement, quotes above, he is speaking of Foote in general, and not
            specifically about Foote the writer.) &nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            I should point out here that Foote misses a tremendous opportunity
            making Frederick Douglass one of the &ldquo;Great Men&rdquo; of his
            story. Not only was he one of the truly great speakers and writers
            of the period&mdash;whose prose is perhaps only exceeded by Lincoln,
            and perhaps only equaled by Grant&rsquo;s memoirs&mdash;but Foote
            would have done wonderfully describing Lincoln through
            Douglass&rsquo;s perspective, so often one of righteous urgency. The
            historian David Blight has a biography out on Douglass which is
            apparently wonderful. Penguin also now has a &ldquo;Portable
            Douglass&rdquo; with many of his speeches as well as his famed
            autobiography. Douglass is one of the few recognizably
            &ldquo;modern&rdquo; figures among the Great Men of that era,
            although Grant comes close. Foote would add Forrest as well, I
            think, but that isn&rsquo;t a can of worms we will open today.
